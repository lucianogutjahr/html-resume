    <h1>My Hobbies </h1>
    <p>I like to play games and sometimes stream them on twitch, love playing D&D with my friends, love to try different drinks and beers but I don't like wine, my favorite genre of games would be any Souls like games, recently discovered that I like programming and that's why I'm migrating to this area of technology, I have five cats (love cats) I'm starting to watch animes and I love going to the theaters, my favorite movies are the LOTR trilogy .</p>
    <p>In summary, I'm an adaptable and multifaceted individual, blending creativity, analytical thinking, and sociability across your diverse interests, from gaming and programming to socializing, storytelling, and enjoying various forms of entertainment.</p>
